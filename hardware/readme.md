Note that the 3D Printing files are only to store the models. It’s suggested to place, orient, and add supports yourself to ensure the best printing quality.


## Notes
- New release on XLeRobot 0.4.0: dual-wheel setup, more versatile arm base (choose your own mounting direction).
- The .3mf file contains soft finray fingers that need to be printed with TPU95A. If you want original SO101 finger, just download the original SO101 .stl file.

- The .3mf file contains 2 version of the single RGB head camera connector and shell, one for webcam & realsense, the other for the cheaper camera same as the hand camera.

- No need to adjust the base connector this time, just print the washers and insert them into the IKEA cart for the best base support.
